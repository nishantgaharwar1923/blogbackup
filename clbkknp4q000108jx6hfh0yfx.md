# Web Server

A web server is a computer that hosts websites and enables them to be accessed over the internet. It stores the files that make up a website, such as HTML documents, images, and cascading style sheets (CSS), and sends them to a user's web browser upon request. This enables the user to view the website in their browser.

Web servers typically run server software, such as Apache or Nginx, that listens for incoming requests from web browsers and sends the requested files in response. The web server may also run additional software, such as a database management system or a content management system, to store and retrieve the data that is used to generate the website.

Web servers are an essential component of the internet, as they allow users to access websites and the information and services they provide. They are typically hosted in data centers, which provide a secure and reliable environment for the servers to operate in.

Web servers can be either dedicated or shared. A dedicated web server is a single physical server that is dedicated to hosting a single website or a small number of websites. A shared web server, on the other hand, hosts many websites on a single physical server, each with its own domain name and web files. Shared web servers are often used by small websites or those that do not require a large number of server resources.

In summary, a web server is a computer that hosts websites and enables them to be accessed over the internet. It stores the files that make up a website and sends them to a user's web browser upon request. Web servers are an essential component of the internet and are typically hosted in data centers.
